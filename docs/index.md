This project is a simple demo which incorporates a speech recognition model that was developed in Keras and ported to CoreML. It performs some (very inaccurate) classification of speech commands based on audio received from the microphone. 

## Speech Class Labels
- silence
- yes
- no
- up
- down
- left
- right
- on
- off
- stop
- go
- unknown
